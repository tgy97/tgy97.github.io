My name is Tian Guiyu(田贵宇). I am currently a second-year master student at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com). Before, I obtained B.S. degree from EECS, Peking University.  
My research interests lie in Backdoor Attack, Video Understanding and Zero Shot Learning.
